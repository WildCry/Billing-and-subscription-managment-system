# Billing-and-subscription-managment-system

This is a hobby project to futher hone my programming skills. Managing billing and subscriptions is a critical component for many businesses, especially SaaS (Software as a Service) companies. Building such a system will not only enhance your programming skills but also give you insights into the business side of software development.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of each stage, along with some considerations and I am taking:

## Stage 1: Annual Subscriptions with Command-Line Interface

### Objectives:
1. Create a database to store customer details, subscription details, and payment history.
2. Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for customer and subscription data.
3. Implement a billing mechanism to charge customers annually.
4. Generate reports on active subscriptions, revenue, etc.

### Steps:
1. **Database Design**:
   - Tables: Customers, Subscriptions, Payments.
   - Relationships: One customer can have multiple subscriptions; one subscription can have multiple payments.
   
2. **Command-Line Interface**:
   - Options to add, view, update, and delete customer details.
   - Options to add, view, update, and delete subscription details.
   - Option to bill a customer.
   - Option to generate reports.

3. **Billing Mechanism**:
   - Integrate with a payment gateway (like Stripe, PayPal) for processing payments.
   - Implement logic to calculate the amount due for each customer based on their subscription.

## Stage 2: Web-App Interface

### Objectives:
1. Create a user-friendly web interface for the system.
2. Implement user authentication and authorization.
3. Provide a dashboard for quick insights.

### Steps:
1. **Web Framework**:
   - Choose a web framework suitable for your language of choice (e.g., Flask/Django for Python).
   
2. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement sign-up, login, and logout functionality.
   - Use secure password hashing and session management.

3. **Dashboard**:
   - Display active subscriptions, upcoming renewals, total revenue, etc.
   - Offer search and filter options for customer and subscription data.

## Stage 3: Generalization

### Objectives:
1. Support different billing cycles (monthly, quarterly, etc.).
2. Implement tiered pricing and discount codes.
3. Provide API endpoints for third-party integrations.

### Steps:
1. **Flexible Billing**:
   - Update the database and logic to handle different billing cycles.
   - Implement pro-rata calculations for mid-cycle changes.

2. **Tiered Pricing & Discounts**:
   - Allow different pricing tiers for subscriptions.
   - Implement logic for applying discount codes.

3. **API Endpoints**:
   - Design RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations.
   - Implement authentication and authorization for API access.

Main goals of project:
- **Scalability**: How will the system perform as the number of customers grows?
- **Security**: Protecting customer data and payment information is crucial.
- **Usability**: A user-friendly interface can make a big difference in adoption and user satisfaction.
